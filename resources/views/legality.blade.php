                <p>
                    UNICORN FUNDS COMMUNITY (UFC) is an online community which connects participants
                    requiring financial assistance with participants who are able and willing to provide such
                    financial assistance. Aside the moral obligation to reciprocate no legal binding relationship
                    is called into being, the interaction between the parties being  PROVIDING HELP OR GETTING HELP and
                    NOT an INVESTMENT or DEPOSIT. Participants may have an expectation that when the need arises there will
                    be a fellow participant who will donate to them too. This however remains just an expectation, the
                    fulfilment of which is entirely dependent on other participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The decision to donate remains exclusively with participants in the system and the computer program is merely
                    the matching platform. Participants are furthermore also warned not to offer assistance from money which they
                    may require to sustain themselves but to do so only from surplus funds which they may have available.
                    Members are not allowed to provide help until they are aware with the risks involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be emphasized that although Unicorn Funds Community is a legally registered P2P system, participants
                    in Unicorn Funds Community donate money not to UFC itself (UNICORN FUNDS COMMUNITY- GHANA is not a legal persona,
                    it's  not involved in financial operations and does not operate as a bank or with bank accounts),
                    participants DONATE money to each other willingly. This refutes the notion that the Unicorn Fund Community takes deposits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is impossible to forbid someone from GETTING HELP from a member of a community and to such it is impossible to forbid
                    Unicorn Funds Community (UFC)
